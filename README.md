## What is Fibre Optic Kitten

Fibre Optic Kitten is a blogging platform that uses a git repository as the source for content instead of a database. This allows you to use a service like github as a source for content. The benefit is that content can be generated on your local machine and pushed up using git, and that other people could actually submit pull requests to update or correct old blog posts.

This is mainly an experiment in using git for version control in fields other than programming.

## How to setup / deploy

There is not currently any functional implementation.

### FAQ

##### Why 'Fibre Optic Kitten'

The name was completely random, it happened to sound a bit funny so it was used. Fundamentally it does not mean anything at all.

##### Why git?

Git was used to allow easy version control, and a minimal back end. In theory this will allow for a faster website as the database will not be filled to the brim with `text` columns.
